# Simulation and Modeling Lab - Assignment 1  
## Assignment Details  
**Assignment:** Lab Assignment 1  
**Topic:** Random Data Visualization and Matrix Operations  

## Tasks Performed  
1. **Generate and Plot Random Vectors:**  
   - Created two vectors with 15 random float values and plotted them on the same graph.  
   - Labeled axes and added a title for better understanding.  

2. **Matrix Heatmap Visualization:**  
   - Generated a 4x4 matrix with random values and visualized it as a heatmap.  
   - Added labels for rows and columns.  

3. **Matrix Operations and Visualization:**  
   - Performed addition, subtraction, and multiplication on two 4x4 matrices.  
   - Visualized the results using bar plots.  

## What I Learned  
In this assignment, I learned how to generate random data using `numpy` and visualize it effectively with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. I practiced matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Additionally, I gained an understanding of creating heatmaps and bar plots to analyze results visually.

## Tools and Libraries Used  
- **Python 3.x**  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`  
- `sympy`
